# Oneiroi
---
## Oneiroi is an iOS app that combines music and dreams. Throughout history, dreams have been analyzed sometimes influencing decisions or interpreted as visions. They can contain memories, loved ones, fears, and so much more. Just like dreams, music has also been central to humanity. Music carries messages, history, and can also capture emotions often without lyrics. Music is also closely tied to providing some benefits to individuals with Alzheimers. Music can stimulate areas associated with emotion and memories, hence inspiring this app. Oneiroi intends to allow users to record their dreams and then create playlists, so that one can also remember the feelings, smells, and other parts of a dream that written texts often can not capture.
